I currently have a temporary recording studio setup at my Airbnb that will allow me to record and edit the threading/multiprocessing videos. I am going to be moving into my new house in 10 days and once I have my recording studio setup then you can expect much faster video releases. I really appreciate how patient everyone has been while I go through this move, especially those of you who are contributing monthly through YouTube \n"
